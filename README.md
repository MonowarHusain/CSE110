# CSE110_PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGE-I
## Course overview
CSE110: Programming Language I gives an overview of basic operations, data types, operators, decision-making, and iterations. Advanced topics like list, tuple, dictionary, classes, and objects are also introduced. Students also learn to build and test small computer programs using an appropriate computer programming language. For this semester, this course will be taught using Python 3. Students are expected to do a significant amount of practice on problem-solving and program design to reinforce the lecture material. The course includes a compulsory 3-hour weekly lab session, where students implement the concepts learned by writing computer programs.
## Learning outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Identify the basic structures of computer programs (Tech Awareness)
* Identify common problem patterns and associate them with programming structures (Critical Thinking Skills)
* Apply solution patterns to relevant real-world problems (Critical Thinking Skills)
* Analyze computer programs and verify output (Quantitative Skills)
* Design small computer programs (Critical Thinking Skills)


## Requirements
* Basic high school level mathematical knowledge is sufficient.
* No programming knowledge is required. This course is for beginners with zero knowledge in programming.
